    "#### Tuples have only two built-in methods compared to lists because tuples are meant to be simple and lightweight data structures that are used to store and manage small amounts of data. Lists, on the other hand, are more complex data structures that support a wider range of operations, such as insertion, deletion, and sorting of elements. Tuples are designed to be more efficient and faster than lists, and having fewer methods helps to achieve this. The focus is on efficiency and speed, rather than a large number of methods and functions.Tuples are also immutable, so there is no need for methods to modify their elements.\n",

    "#### Tuples are usually used as keys in dictionaries, where the order and immutability of the elements are important, and having fewer methods makes them easier to use and less prone to errors.\n",

The two methods that tuples do have are sufficient for their intended purpose, which is to provide an efficient and lightweight way of representing simple data structures.\n"
